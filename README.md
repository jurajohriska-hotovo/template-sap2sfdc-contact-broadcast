# Anypoint Template: SAP to Salesforce Contact Broadcast

# License Agreement
This template is subject to the conditions of the 
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates-examples/AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf">MuleSoft License Agreement</a>.
Review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. You can use this template for free 
with the Mule Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case
This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of Contacts from SAP to Salesforce in manner of push notification. Every time there is a new Contact or a change in an already existing one, SAP will send the IDoc with it to the running template which will update/create a Contact in the Salesforce target instance.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). The batch job is divided in *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

The integration is triggered by an inbound SAP endpoint listening for incoming IDOC **DEBMAS01** messages including information about Customer's Contacts. This XML is passed to the batch process and transformed to a Salesforce Contact.

In this template you may choose whether Account for Contact should be created as well during the process.
This functionality relies on a standard BAPI for retrieving details about customers: **BAPI\_CUSTOMER\_GETDETAIL2**

# Considerations

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered.
All of them deal with the preparations in both source (SAP) and destination (SFDC) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly.
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before using this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, you need to add three extra dependencies for SAP to the pom.xml file.


## SAP Considerations

Here's what you need to know to get this template to work with SAP.

### As a Data Source

The SAP backend system is used as a source of data. The SAP connector is used to send and receive the data from the SAP backend. 
The connector can either use RFC calls of BAPI functions and/or IDoc messages for data exchange, and needs to be properly customized per the "Properties to Configure" section.

The Partner profile needs to have a customized type of logical system set as partner type. An outbound parameter of message type DEBMAS should be defined in the partner profile. A RFC destination created earlier should be defined as Receiver Port. IDoc Type base type should be set as DEBMAS01.

## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work.

### FAQ

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>


### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using Salesforce as a data destination.

### Importing a Template into Studio
In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your
Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click **Open**.


### Running on Studio
After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`
+ Click `Run`
In order to make this Anypoint Template run on Mule Studio there are a few extra steps that needs to be made.
Please check this Documentation Page:

+ [Enabling Your Studio Project for SAP](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP)

### Running on Mule Standalone
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties and run your app with the corresponding environment variable. To follow the example, this is `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub
While creating your application on CloudHub (or you can do it later as a next step), go to Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as the **mule.env**.


### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub
Studio provides an easy way to deploy your template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so check this


## Properties to Configure
To use this template, configure properties (credentials, configurations, etc.) in the properties file or in CloudHub from Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties. The sections that follow list example values.
### Application Configuration
**Application Configuration**
+ page.size `200`

**SAP Connector configuration**

+ sap.jco.ashost `your.sap.address.com`
+ sap.jco.user `SAP_USER`
+ sap.jco.passwd `SAP_PASS`
+ sap.jco.sysnr `14`
+ sap.jco.client `800`
+ sap.jco.lang `EN`

**SAP Endpoint configuration**

+ sap.jco.operationtimeout `10000`
+ sap.jco.connectioncount `2`
+ sap.jco.gwhost `your.sap.addres.com`
+ sap.jco.gwservice `sapgw14`
+ sap.jco.idoc.programid `PROGRAM_ID`

**SalesForce Connector configuration**

+ sfdc.username `bob.dylan@sfdc`
+ sfdc.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`

**Policy for creating accounts in SF syncAccount, doNotCreateAccount**

+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`

**Note:** the property **account.sync.policy** can take any of the two following values:

+ **doNotCreateAccount**: application will do nothing in what respect to the account and it'll just move the contact over.
+ **syncAccount**: it will try to create the contact's account if this is not pressent in the Salesforce instance.

# API Calls
SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made.
Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to
consider. Product Broadcast Template calls to the API can be
calculated using the formula:

**X * 3 + X / ${page.size}**

Being X the number of Contacts to be synchronized on each run.

Multiplication by 3 is because for every user if account.sync.policy is set to value **syncAccounts** for every contact will be checked
if an account with matching name exists in Salesforce and if not it will be created.

The division by ${page.size} is because contacts are gathered in groups
of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the commit step.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 31 api
calls to SFDC will be made (worst case scenario). If the account in Salesforce alerady exists or account synchronization
is disabled, there will be fewer API calls made.


# Customize It!
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template.

More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml


## config.xml
Configuration for connectors and configuration properties are set in this file. Even change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified are in properties file, which is the recommended place to make your changes. However if you want to do core changes to the logic, you need to modify this file.

In the Studio visual editor, the properties are on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml
The business logic XML file creates or updates objects in the destination system for a represented use case. You can customize and extend the logic of this template in this XML file to more meet your needs.



## endpoints.xml
This file is formed by a flow containing the endpoints for triggering the template and for retrieving the objects that meet the defined criteria in the query. You can then execute the batch job process with the query results.



## errorHandling.xml
This is the right place to handle how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. 
This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
